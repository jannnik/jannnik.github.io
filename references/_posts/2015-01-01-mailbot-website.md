The main goal of the project was the development of a software for delivery of letters and packages inside of the informatics building at Stuttgart University. Available was a mobile „PR2” robot with two arms and the great ROS ecosystem. My part was to implement a website to control the robot by remote and provide a pickup service interface for everyman.

The website provides an interface which allows creating orders, tracking the status of packages and tracking the robots' position on a map. For administrators the website provides a backend with full control over the order data, a user management system with registration and login, information about the robot's data like battery status and an interface to control the robot by remote.

In this project I used **_php_**, **_mysql_**, **_javascript_** (with [roslibjs](http://wiki.ros.org/roslibjs)) and **_css_** (with [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com)).
