It was a very small WordPress project: the goal was to have a multilingual homepage for the guitarist Aleksi Rajala which presents himself and where he could make advertising for his guitar lessons.

To realize the website I used **_WordPress_** with the great minimal **_[Fukasawa Theme](http://www.andersnoren.se/teman/fukasawa-wordpress-theme/)_** by Anders Noren. To support English and German language I use the **_Polylang_** plugin. For presenting the events and news on the home page I implemented a Child Theme which offers some shortcodes and adds a custom  post type for events.
